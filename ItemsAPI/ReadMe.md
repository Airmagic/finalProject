  3. Ensure the pips are installed from the requirements document
      pip install -r requirements.txt
  4. to start the API run the program and it should start up
  5. If you want to see the json file you can navigate to 127.0.0.5000/items

    Now that the API program is running locally your JAVA GUI or any other program that
    is set up to use this program can access it on your computer.
